5. PAYMENT.
5.1 Fees: Payment for all fees for the provision of Services such as servers, virtual servers, shared storage and backups shall be due on the next Anniversary Billing Date. One time fees, such as setup fees, bandwidth, storage, administrative fees and late fees, are due and payable when invoiced, and/or as agreed by Pagoda Box through the Customer Dashboard.

5.2 Payment Methods: The payment shall be made by the credit card (or other acceptable method of payment, in Pagoda Box’s sole discretion) (the “MOP”) maintained on file with Pagoda Box.  Customer is responsible to update the MOP periodically and failure to do so may result in the termination of this Agreement and the termination of any Applications owned by Customer in Pagoda Box’s sole discretion. Pagoda Box is authorized to charge the MOP on file automatically each month on the Anniversary Billing Date for all fees incurred by Customer since the prior Anniversary Billing Date and such authorization may be revoked only prospectively as to fees not yet incurred by Customer.

5.3 Taxes: All prices and fees specified in or referred to in this MSA are stated exclusive of any tax, including withholding tax, sales, use, value added, levies, import and custom duties, excise or other similar or equivalent taxes imposed on the supply of Services. Any sales, use, levies, excise, withholding taxes or similar charges, direct or indirect, applicable or to become applicable, which are levied as a result of the supply of the Services shall be paid by the Customer. Neither party shall be liable for the other party’s taxes based on income. If withholding tax applies to any payments for Services made under this MSA, the Customer may deduct such taxes and shall pay such taxes to the appropriate tax authority; provided that Customer shall provide Pagoda Box with an official receipt for any such taxes withheld and must notify Pagoda Box prior to payment that withholding tax is required to be paid and Customer shall pay to Pagoda Box any additional amount to ensure that Pagoda Box receives the full amount of the invoice. If Pagoda Box has the legal obligation to pay or collect taxes for which Customer is responsible under this paragraph, the appropriate amount shall be charged to and paid by Customer in addition to the amount of the invoice, unless Customer provides Pagoda Box with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. The parties undertake to cooperate, where possible, to minimize the amount of withholding tax due by making advance clearance applications under the relevant double taxation treaties (where applicable) to the relevant tax authority to reduce the rate of withholding tax or exempt entirely this amount if applicable. In any event, the Customer undertakes to account for any tax withheld to the tax authorities on a timely basis.

5.4 SLA Credits: SLA Credits, if issued to Customer’s account, shall be used only to offset future charges for certain Services as provided in the Service Level Agreement. SLA Credits may not be sold, converted to cash or transferred to Third Parties or Affiliates. SLA Credits shall expire on the termination or expiration of the MSA.

5.5 Additional Fees. The Customer’s failure to pay any fees on the due date shall result in incurring a late fee of $5 per Application. If Pagoda Box has suspended the Customer’s access to the Services over the Public Network as provided in Section 15, the Customer shall incur a $5 per Application reconnection fee. Such fees shall be due upon receipt, and Pagoda Box will not reconnect any Services to the Customer until full payment of such fees plus any and all amounts then due for the Services.

5.6 Refunds & Disputes: All fees paid for Services to Pagoda Box are non-refundable. If the Customer believes that the bills are in error, the Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy is to seek SLA credits by sending an email to billing@nanobox.com within 30 days of the receipt of the disputed bill, which will open a billing ticket to give notice to Pagoda Box. Any invoice not disputed by Customer in accordance with this section within 30 days of receipt of the invoice shall be deemed conclusively accepted by Customer as correct. Customer shall not chargeback any credit card payments to Pagoda Box and any such chargeback will result in an additional payment to Pagoda Box of up to $500 which is a reasonable estimate of Pagoda Box’s additional administrative costs to contest any such chargeback. Customer is responsible for any fees and costs (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs and collection agency fees) incurred by Pagoda Box in enforcing collection of fees.

If Customer transfers or is otherwise involved in the transfer of any Customer Content (whether in connection with its business or otherwise) over the Public Network or Private Networks, then Customer is solely responsible for compliance with any applicable laws, rules and regulations in any and all applicable regions or countries regarding the security, privacy, legality and/or safe handling of such Customer Content.

8. INDEMNIFICATION BY CUSTOMER: Customer hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Pagoda Box and its parents, Affiliates, licensors and providers of Third Party Services, and their respective directors, officers, employees, contractors, agents, successors, and assigns, (collectively, the “Pagoda Box Parties”) (Pagoda Box and each of the Pagoda Box Parties, an “Indemnified Party”), from and against any and all liability (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and costs) incurred by the Indemnified Parties in connection with any actual or alleged suit, claim, damages, harm, or other responsibility whatsoever  (“Claim”) arising out of: (a) Customer’s use of the Services or Third Party Services; (b) any breach or alleged breach by Customer of this MSA; (c) any breach or alleged breach by Customer or Customer End Users of a Third Party’s rights, including, without limitation, any actual or alleged infringement or misappropriation of a Third Party’s copyright, trade secret, patent, trademark, privacy, publication or other proprietary right; (d) any damage caused by or alleged to have been caused by Customer or Customer End Users to the Site or Services; or (e) any actual or alleged violation or non-compliance by Customer or Customer End Users with any applicable law, court order, rule or regulation in any jurisdiction.

Normal Methods of Resolution for Violations of Nanobox’s Acceptable Use Policy
The goal of our Normal Methods of Resolution is to mitigate service interruptions while resolving potential violations under this AUP.  Our sales, support and abuse staffs are dedicated to working with the Customer in resolving potential violations, and are available via support ticket / email. The Normal Methods of Resolution below is provided for informational purposes only and forms the framework and guidance with respect to resolving potential violations.  However, Pagoda Box reserves the right to take immediate action to address any violation of its Acceptable Use Policy at any time in its sole discretion, and you should not assume that any particular violation of the AUP will be handled as set forth below.  Even for violations that are handled in accordance with these procedures, timing, order, and speed of these procedures for resolution may differ according to the degree of the violation, the nature of the violation, involvement of law enforcement, involvement of third party litigation, or other related factors.

Step 1: First alleged violation of AUP: a ticket will be generated under Pagoda Box to provide the Customer’s master user with information regarding the potential violation of the Nanobox AUP. This is often a fact-finding email requiring further information or notifying Customer of the potential violation and the required actions to resolve the issue.

Step 2: Acknowledgment of violation of AUP: a ticket is generated under the Customer’s user account with information specific to the violation. This ticket will also include any additional facts about the situation and will notify Customer of the action required to resolve the violation.

Step 3: Violation of AUP disregarded, not properly addressed, or continuing violation if a ticket has been disregarded, not properly addressed, or resolved by the Customer for a specified period of time: Pagoda Box engineers will turn the public network port to the specified dedicated services off. Access to the dedicated services may then be achieved through the secure private service network for Customer resolution. As soon as the violation is addressed, the public access shall be restored and service will continue as normal.

Step 4: Failure to address violation and resolve violation: if Customer fails to address the violation AND fails to resolve the violation, a suspension of services shall occur. This is a last resort for Pagoda Box and only results when the Customer completely fails to participate in Pagoda Box’s resolution process. A permanent suspension of services includes reclamation of all dedicated services and the destruction of Customer’s data.

Customer will indemnify Pagoda Box, its officers, employees, shareholders, contractors, and others from and against any suit, claim, damage assessment, or other liability of any kind or sort whatsoever (including without limitation legal fees and costs), which derives in whole or in part from Customer’s use of the Services to collect, process, use, store, maintain, or otherwise handle PII or other regulated information.  

The Data We Collect and How We Use It
Pagoda Box collects data from users for the following purposes:

• To engage in transactions for service. Name, address, email, purchase details, and credit card/payment information may be collected and stored as part of the transaction history. The majority of the data collected under this category is contact information. Pagoda Box may need to share some of this data (address, payment) with credit card clearing houses, banking institutions, and other similarly situated Agents, who may require the information in order to complete the transaction (as used here, “Agents” are persons or companies who act on behalf of or under the direction of Pagoda Box). 

• To provide future service and support. Information collected for this purpose is both contact data and information related to products and service/support requested. This information is also used to provide service, product update, and similar notices.

• To select content, data may be collected to help create Site content and navigation that is most relevant and user friendly. This includes data collected as a result of site navigation, as well as data provided in forms.

• To respond to user inquiries and requests for information. This data includes registrations for online newsletters, opt-in mailing lists and specific requests for further information.

• To respond to law enforcement organizations, government officials, third parties when compelled by subpoena, court order, or applicable law, or to report or prevent suspected fraudulent or illegal activity in the use of the Services. Pagoda Box will notify Customer of the information request or submission as, and if, allowed.

• To our contractors who provide services or perform functions on our behalf.

• If we are acquired by or merged with another company, if substantially all of our assets are transferred to another company, or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding, we may transfer the information we have collected from you to another entity if applicable.

• To better tailor marketing to User needs. We may use information from User purchases and User-specified requirements to provide you with timely and pertinent notices of Pagoda Box product releases and service developments that address your needs and specified requirements and/or which are similar to products and services previously purchased by the User from Pagoda Box.

• To better respond to requests for service or quotes for product and equipment purchase. Pagoda Box will pass contact information to the appropriate Pagoda Box sales person, or reseller for follow-up related to Pagoda Box products or services.

• From referral “tell a friend” function. If a User elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our Site, we ask them for the friend’s name and email address. Pagoda Box will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the Site and send a copy of said e-mail to the User. The e-mail(s) sent shall clearly identify the sender of such email(s). Pagoda Box uses this data for the sole purpose of sending this onetime email. Such email sent to a friend at User’s request will not be stored for additional processing.

• As a result of your participation in interactive discussions and public forums. There are parts of the Site that permit you to participate in interactive discussions. Some of these are moderated; all are subject to access for technical reasons. Pagoda Box does not control the content that Users post and some may serve as public discussion forums. As in any interactive forum open to many Users, you should carefully consider whether you wish to submit data and should tailor any other content submitted accordingly.

Customer Dashboard, Customer Customization, Preferences and Opt-Out

New Customers are automatically registered for access at dashboard.nanobox.io/users/register. The Customer Dashboard allows Customers the ability to create accounts and opt in (or out) of Services and mailing lists. The Customer Dashboard provides the Customers with control over their preferences for electronic information delivery.

Pagoda Box has also provided the Customer’s master user the ability to manage the Customer’s Account Information. We maintain the data and allow the Customer’s master user to update it at any time. To change this information, you must be a current Customer and login with a user ID and password and follow the prompts to “update my profile” on the Customer Dashboard. We continue to expand the profile of Services and information that you may access and update.

Please note that some email communications are not subject to general opt-out. These include communications related to downloads; communications about sales transactions; information about software updates, patches and fixes; disclosures to comply with legal requirements; and network upgrades or other related maintenance for Service.

If an individual’s PII is to be (a) disclosed by Pagoda Box (other than as the result of an Application or Customer Content utilizing the Services) to a Third Party who is not an Agent; or (b) used by Pagoda Box (other than as a result of an Application or Customer Content utilizing the Services)  for a purpose that is incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual, then the individual will be notified prior to such disclosure and may opt-out of the disclosure by responding to the email and/or author of the notification, using any response method designated by Pagoda Box in the notification..

Security
Pagoda Box is concerned with the security of the data we have collected and utilizes commercially reasonable measures to prevent unauthorized access to that information. These measures include policies, procedures, employee training, physical access and technical elements relating to data access controls. In addition, Pagoda Box uses standard security protocols and mechanisms to facilitate the exchange and the transmission of sensitive data, such as credit card details. Pagoda Box does not process PII in a way that is incompatible with the purposes for which it has been collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.

In the event that PII is acquired, or is reasonably believed to have been acquired, by an unauthorized person and applicable law requires notification, Pagoda Box will notify the affected individual of the breach by email or ticket on the Customer Dashboard or, if Pagoda Box is unable to contact the individual by email or ticket on the Customer Dashboard, then by regular mail. Notice will be given promptly, consistent with the legitimate needs of law enforcement and any measures necessary for Pagoda Box or law enforcement to determine the scope of the breach and to ensure or restore the integrity of the data system. Pagoda Box may delay notification if Pagoda Box or a law enforcement agency determines that the notification will impede a criminal investigation, and in such case, notification will not be provided unless and until Pagoda Box or the agency determines that notification will not compromise the investigation.

Enforcement
Pagoda Box has established internal mechanisms to verify its ongoing adherence to its privacy policy. Pagoda Box also encourages individuals covered by this privacy policy to raise any concerns about our processing of personal information by contacting Pagoda Box at the address below. Pagoda Box will seek to resolve any concerns.

In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect the PII already stored in our database, we will notify you by email or post a prominent notice on the Customer Dashboard notifying users of the change. In some cases, when we post the notice, we will also email users who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices. We may update this policy from time to time to describe how new site features affect our use of your PII and to let you know of new control and preference features that we provide.
